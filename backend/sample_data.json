    "description": "T1 filing compliance 2023 edition (2021 tax year)\nT1 Filing Compliance is a Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) publication, which presents data about returns that were filed late or on time. The returns are grouped by demographic, geographic, and economic characteristics. The data in the tables are derived from information reported on income tax and benefit returns for the 2021 tax year, processed up to February 4, 2023.\n\nOn this page\nExplanatory notes\nConfidentiality procedures\nClassification variables\nOn-time or late returns\nRefund, balance owing, or nil returns\nLate-filing penalty\nProvince or territory\nForward sortation area\nEmployment status\nAge\nGender\nMarital status\nIncome range\nDescription of the tables\nTables in PDF format\nTables in CSV format\nExplanatory notes\nThis edition of T1 Filing Compliance presents data based on income tax and benefit returns for the 2021 tax year. Initial assessment values were used to produce the tables. Any changes resulting from reassessments are not included. So any of the statistics in this publication may change.\n\nConfidentiality procedures\nTo ensure the protection of tax filer information, data have been suppressed where warranted. As well, counts and amounts are rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. For example, 104 would be rounded to 100 and 105 would be rounded to 110.\n\nClassification variables\nThe following variables are used in one or more of the tables in this publication:\n\nOn-time or late returns\nRefund, balance owing or nil returns\nLate-filing penalty\nProvince or territory\nForward sortation area\nEmployment status\nAge\nGender\nMarital status\nIncome range\nOn-time or late returns\nA tax return is considered on time when it is filed before the deadline for the 2021 tax year. It is late if the return is filed after the deadline. Usually, a return for a specific tax year has to be filed on or before April 30, the following year.  \n\nSelf-employed persons - If a tax filer or his or her spouse or common‑law partner carried on a business in 2021 (other than a business whose expenditures are primarily in connection with a tax shelter), the return for 2021 has to be filed on or before June 15, 2022. \n\nException to the due date of a return - When the due date falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a public holiday recognized by the Canada Revenue Agency, a return is considered on time if the agency receives it or if it is postmarked on or before the next business day.\n\nDeceased persons - If a tax filer is filing for a deceased person, the due date may be different. For more information, see Guide T4011, Preparing Returns for Deceased Persons 2021.\n\nRefund, balance owing, or nil returns\nA refund return refers to a return with the amount on line 48400 (Refund) greater than $2.\n\nA balance owing return refers to a return with the amount on line 48500 (Balance owing) greater than $2.\n\nA nil return refers to a return with the amount on line 48400 (Refund) no greater than $2 and the amount on line 48500 (Balance owing) no greater than $2.\n\nLate-filing penalty\nIf a tax filer has a balance owing for the 2021 tax year and they file their 2021 return after the filing deadline, a late-filing penalty is charged. The penalty is 5% of the 2021 balance owing, plus 1% of the balance owing for each full month the return is late, to a maximum of 12 months.\n\nNote\nIf a late-filing penalty was charged for a tax filer’s 2018, 2019, or 2020 return, a repeat late-filing penalty for 2021 is charged. The penalty is 10% of the 2021 balance owing, plus 2% of the 2021 balance owing for each full month the return is late, to a maximum of 20 months.\n\nThe repeat late-filing penalty is not included in the tables of this edition.\n\nProvince or territory\nProvince or territory of residence, used in tables 1A, 1A.1, 1A.2 and 2A, refers to the province or territory in which the tax filer resided on December 31, 2021, as reported on his or her income tax and benefit return.\n\nProvince or territory of mailing address, used in tables 1B and 2B, refers to the province or territory that was the tax filer’s mailing province or territory on the filing date, as reported on his or her income tax and benefit return.\n\nForward sortation area\nCanada Post defines a forward sortation area as the first three characters of a postal code representing a set of well-defined specific areas within a major geographic region, province or territory. The first character identifies the province or territory; the second character identifies whether the area is urban or rural; and the third character, in combination with the first two characters, identifies a more precise geographic district—a specific rural region, an entire medium-sized city or a section of a major metropolitan area.\n\nA table of provinces and their province code\nProvince or territory code\tProvince or territory\n10\tNewfoundland and Labrador\n11\tPrince Edward Island\n12\tNova Scotia\n13\tNew Brunswick\n24\tQuebec\n35\tOntario\n46\tManitoba\n47\tSaskatchewan\n48\tAlberta\n59\tBritish Columbia\n60\tNorthwest Territories\n61\tYukon\n62\tNunavut\n99\tOutside Canada\nNote\nTo keep the statistical completeness across tables, tax filers outside Canada are assigned code “99,” which is not included in the forward sortation areas.\n\nEmployment status\nIf a tax filer or his or her spouse or common‑law partner carried on a business in 2021 (other than a business whose expenditures are primarily in connection with a tax shelter), then his or her return is classified as a self-employed return. A return other than a self-employed return is classified as an employee return.\n\nAge\nThe age of a tax filer is determined from the reported year of birth on page 1 of the income tax and benefit return. For individuals who did not report a year of birth, their age is imputed by the CRA for statistical completeness.\n\nGender\nThe gender of the tax filer is gathered from information on file with the CRA. Gender is defined to be female, male, gender diverse, or unknown. Individuals whose gender is non-binary are represented in the gender diverse category. Tax filers for whom no gender code is available, for example, non-residents who applied for an Individual Tax Number, are counted in the “unknown” category.\n\nMarital status\nMarital status refers to the marital status of the tax filer on the filing date. Specific to this publication, the only marital statuses shown are not married and married. The former status includes all single, separated, divorced, widowed, and unstated tax filers. The latter status includes all married and common-law tax filers.\n\nIncome range\nThe income ranges given in the tables are based on the total income assessed. This corresponds to line 15000 of the 2021 income tax and benefit return. There are 19 income ranges:\n\n$4,999 and under\nbetween $5,000 and $9,999\nbetween $10,000 and $14,999\nbetween $15,000 and $19,999\nbetween $20,000 and $24,999\nbetween $25,000 and $29,999\nbetween $30,000 and $34,999\nbetween $35,000 and $39,999\nbetween $40,000 and $44,999\nbetween $45,000 and $49,999\nbetween $50,000 and $54,999\nbetween $55,000 and $59,999\nbetween $60,000 and $69,999\nbetween $70,000 and $79,999\nbetween $80,000 and $89,999\nbetween $90,000 and $99,999\nbetween $100,000 and $149,999\nbetween $150,000 and $249,999\n$250,000 and over\nDescription of the tables\nTables 1A to 1F present the number of on-time filing returns and late-filing returns by province or territory, forward sortation area, employment status, age group, gender, marital status, and income range.\n\nTables 2A to 2F present information on the late-filing penalty by province or territory, forward sortation area, age group, gender, marital status, and income range.\n\nTables in PDF format\nThe following tables are available in PDF format.

    "description": "Selected T1 Statistics 2023 edition (for the 2022 tax year)\nThe Selected T1 Statistics publication presents data from the most recently assessed individual income tax and benefit returns. This 2023 edition is based on 100% of the returns up to the cut-off date of October 1, 2022. These statistics contain the most recent 2022 tax year assessments or reassessments up to the cut-off date. The purpose of this publication is to release preliminary T1 statistics related to common line items in the Income Tax and Benefit Return. For more complete information on T1 statistics, please refer to the T1 Final Statistics publication.\n\nTable of contents\nExplanatory notes\nConfidentiality procedures\nMajor changes for the 2022 tax year\nMajor classification variables\nIncome classification\nMajor source of income classification\nAge classification\nGender classification\nProvincial or territorial classification\nDescription of items\nNumber of returns\nIncome items\nDeduction items\nNon-refundable tax credits\nTax payable\nTable Descriptions\nTables in CSV format\nExplanatory notes\nThe 2023 edition of the Selected T1 Statistics presents data based on 2022 tax year returns filed and processed up to October 1, 2023. The most recent assessment is used to compile the statistics. As a result, for returns that have been reassessed, the most current reassessed values are used to prepare the tables.\n\nAll of the statistics in this publication are subject to revision.\n\nThe tables were produced in a “tidy” format. This standard makes data analysis easier for users of the data, making the datasets ideal for spreadsheet or analytics software. This structure facilitates analysis using software without the analyst having to re-organize the data. In this format, each variable appears in a single column and each observation forms a separate row.\n\nConfidentiality procedures\nTo ensure the protection of tax filer information, data have been suppressed where warranted. A zero [0] indicates that the information has been suppressed for confidentiality purposes. Suppressed information also includes valid zeroes. As well, counts are rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. For example, 104 would be rounded to 100 and 105 would be rounded to 110. Dollar amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand. Totals may not add up due to rounding or suppression.  \n\nMajor changes for the 2022 tax year\nThe major changes for the 2022 tax year which pertain to this publication are listed below. For more details on these and other changes, see the “What’s new in 2022” section in the Federal Income Tax and Benefit Guide.\n\nHome Buyers’ Plan - The amount used to calculate Item 17: Home buyers' amount – Line 31270 of the return increased from $5,000 to $10,000 in the 2022 tax year, which would provide a tax credit of up to $1,500 to eligible home buyers.\n\nOld Age Security - Taxpayers 75 years old or older in June 2022 will get an automatic 10% increase of their Old Age Security pension starting in July 2022.\n\nMajor classification variables\nThe following variables are used in one or more of the tables in this publication:\n\nIncome classification\nMajor source of income classification\nAge classification\nGender classification\nProvincial or territorial classification\nIncome classification\nThe income classes presented in the tables are based on the total income assessed. This corresponds to line 15000 of the return and includes:\n\nemployment income;\npension income;\ninvestment income;\nself-employment income;\nincome from other sources;\nnon-taxable income.\nTotal income assessed may differ from the true economic income presented in other publications because it does not include certain non-taxable income. It may, however, include grossed-up income such as income from eligible dividends, which is the amount of the dividends plus 38%.\n\nSee the detailed list of other forms of non-taxable incomes in the description for total income assessed.\n\nMajor source of income classification\nTax filers do not report their type of work or occupation. The major source of income is determined by the tax filer’s largest net source of income.\n\nFor example, if a tax filer earned a salary but received more net income from investments, this tax filer is classified as an investor, not as an employee.\n\nThe nine major income classifications which the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) uses describe the majority of tax filers who make up each of them:\n\nEmployment – tax filers employed by a business, institution, school, federal or provincial Crown corporation, or some form of government body\nFarming and fishing – self-employed tax filers who earned their major source of income from farming or fishing\nProfessional income – self-employed tax filers whose major source of income is professional fees (including accountants, doctors and surgeons, dentists, lawyers and notaries, engineers and architects, as well as entertainers, artists, etc.)—because the Canada Revenue Agency classifies professionals who earn most of their income in the form of salaries as employees, the number of professionals shown in the publication may be less than the number shown in professional directories\nSales – tax filers whose major source of earnings is commission income from self-employment\nBusiness proprietorship or partnership – tax filers whose major source of income is business income\nInvestment – tax filers whose major source of income is interest, taxable dividends from Canadian corporations, taxable capital gains, and other investment income\nPension – tax filers whose major source of income is pension or split pension income\nSocial benefits – tax filers whose major source of income is employment insurance, social assistance payments, workers’ compensation benefits, and net federal supplements\nOther – tax filers whose major source of income is scholarships, grants, alimony, registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) income, registered disability savings plan income or other unspecified income. Other income includes tax filers with nil amounts in the other major sources of income fields\nGender classification\nThe gender of the tax filer is gathered from information on file with the CRA. Gender is defined to be female, male, gender diverse, or unknown. Individuals whose gender is non-binary are represented in the gender diverse category. Tax filers for whom no gender code is available, for example, non-residents who applied for an Individual Tax Number, are counted in the “unknown” category.\n\nAge classification\nThe age of the tax filer is determined from the reported year of birth on page 1 of the T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return. For individuals who did not report a year of birth, their age is counted in the “unknown” category.\n\nProvincial or territorial classification\nProvince or territory of residence refers to the province or territory in which the tax filer resided on December 31, 2022, as indicated on his or her individual income tax and benefit return.\n\nDescription of items\nNumber of returns\nIncome items\nDeduction items\nNon-refundable tax credits\nTax payable\nNumber of returns\nItem 1: Total number of returns\n\nThis is the total number of returns.\n\nIncome items\nEmployment income\n\nItem 2: Employment income (before deductions) – Line 10100 of the return\n\nThis is income from wages and salaries, commissions, bonuses, tips, gratuities, and honoraria. \n\nItem 3: Other employment income – Line 10400 of the return\n\nThis includes the following amounts:\n\ntips and occasional earnings;\nemployment income not reported on a T4 slip;\nnet research grants;\nclergy’s housing allowance or an amount for eligible utilities;\nforeign employment income;\nincome-maintenance insurance plans (wage-loss replacement plans);\nveterans' benefits;\ncertain GST/HST and Quebec sales tax (QST) rebates;\nroyalties;\namounts received under a supplementary unemployment benefit plan (a guaranteed annual wage plan);\ntaxable benefit for premiums paid under a group term life insurance plan;\nemployee profit-sharing plan;\nmedical premium benefits;\nWage Earner Protection Program;\nBankruptcy settlement.\nPension income\n\nItem 4: Old Age Security (OAS) pension – Line 11300 of the return\n\nThis is a monthly benefit paid to people 65 years of age or older.

This item also includes death and disability benefits and child benefits (if received by a child of a deceased or disabled contributor).\n\nIncome from other sources\n\nItem 6: Taxable amount of dividends (eligible and other than eligible) from taxable Canadian corporations – Line 12000 of the return\n\nThis is the total dividend value, plus a 38% gross-up for the eligible dividends and a 16% gross-up for the dividends other than eligible dividends.

It does not include non-taxable income from the following sources:\n\nGST/HST credit as well as payments from related provincial or territorial programs;\nchild assistance payments and the supplement for children with disabilities paid by the province of Quebec;\namounts received under the new Canada Child Benefit (CCB) program;\ncompensation received from a province or territory for a victim of a criminal act or a motor vehicle accident;\nlottery winnings;\nmost gifts and inheritances;\namounts paid by Canada or an ally (if the amount is not taxable in that country) for disability or death due to war service;\nmost amounts received from a life insurance policy after someone’s death;\nmost payments of the type commonly referred to as strike pay received from a union;\nmost amounts received from a tax-free savings account (TFSA).\nNote\nThe income earned on any of the above amounts (such as interest earned from the investment of lottery winnings) is taxable.\n\nSome parts of total income assessed are in gross amounts, while others are in net amounts. For example, eligible dividend income is grossed up to represent 138% of such income. Interest and investment income are also gross figures since carrying charges are not deducted. On the other hand, taxable capital gains are net amounts because only 50% of the gains realized in 2022 are reported.\n\nDeduction items\nDeductions from total income assessed\n\nItem 12: Child care expenses – Line 21400 of the return\n\nThis is the child care expenses reported on line 21400 of the return.\n\nItem 13: Net income – Line 23600 of the return\n\nThis is the result of subtracting the total deductions and social benefits repayment from total income assessed.\n\nDeductions from net income\n\nItem 14: Total deductions (from net income) – Line 25700 of the return\n\nThis is the total deductions to be applied against net income to calculate taxable income.\n\nItem 15: Taxable income assessed – Line 26000 of the return\n\nFederal Income Tax Brackets\nTaxable income\tTax\n$50,197 or less\t15%\n$50,197 to $100,392\t20.5% plus \n$100,392 to $155,625\t26% plus \n$155,625 to $221,708\t29% plus \nOver $221,708\t33% plus\nNon-refundable tax credits\nTax filers can claim certain non-refundable tax credits in calculating taxes payable for a tax year. These credits reduce the amount of income tax a tax filer owes. If the total of these credits is more than the income tax the tax filer would otherwise owe for the year, the tax filer will not receive a refund for the difference.\n\nItem 16: Canada Caregiver Amount - Lines 30425 and 30450 of the return\n\nCaregiver amounts for spouse or common-law partner, or eligible dependant or other infirm dependants age 18 or older.\n\nItem 17: Home buyers' amount – Line 31270 of the return\n\nThis is the amount that can be claimed for the purchase of a qualifying home if the tax filer or his or her spouse or common-law partner acquired a qualifying home and the tax filer did not live in another home owned by himself or herself or by his or her spouse or common-law partner in the year of acquisition or in any of the four preceding years (first-time home buyer). The maximum the tax filer can claim is $5,000.\n\nNote\nTax filers eligible for the disability amount or those buying the home for the benefit of a related person who is eligible for the disability amount do not need to be first-time home buyers to claim this amount.\n\nItem 18: Total federal non-refundable tax credits – Line 35000 of Schedule 1 of the return\n\nThis is the sum of the federal non-refundable tax credits.

A detailed description of each item is in Description of items.\n\nFor more information on classification variables, see Major classification variables.\n\nFor each table, both the number of tax filers and the respective dollar amounts are shown. In some cases, the total of the figures in the table may not match the total shown, either because of rounding or because of editing for confidentiality purposes. For an explanation of the confidentiality procedures, see Confidentiality procedures.\n\nTable 1 – General statement by province or territory of residence\n\nThis table classifies tax returns according to the province or territory of residence listed on the tax filer’s return and also for returns from outside Canada.

This structure facilitates analysis using software without the analyst having to re-organize the data. In this format, each variable appears in a single column and each observation forms a separate row.\n\nPlease refer to the explanatory notes for information about these tables\n\nTable 1 – General statement by province or territory of residence\nTable 2 – All returns by province or territory of residence and total income class\nTable 3 – All returns by province or territory of residence and major source of income\nTable 4 – All returns by province or territory of residence and age\nTable 5 – All returns by province or territory of residence and gender",
